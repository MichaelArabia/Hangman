# Hangman
First console project at BeCode - Hangman

## Introduction

Hangman is a classic word guessing game. In this implementation, players are provided with a set of blank spaces representing a word. Their goal is to guess the letters of the word one by one. For each incorrect guess, they lose a life. The game ends when the player correctly guesses the word or runs out of lives.

## Features

**Random Word Selection:** The game randomly selects a word from a predefined list, ensuring varied gameplay every time you play.

**Input Validation:** Ensures that players can only input valid alphabetical characters as their guesses.

**Game Status Display:** After every guess, players can view their correctly and wrongly guessed letters, remaining lives, turn count, and error count.

**Restart Option:** Upon completion, players have the option to restart and play again without needing to relaunch the game.
